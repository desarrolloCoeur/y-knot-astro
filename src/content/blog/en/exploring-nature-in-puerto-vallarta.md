These excursions take you to the Pacific Ocean, where you will have the opportunity to see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.","At K-not, we offer whale and dolphin watching tours from December to March, when humpback whales migrate from Alaska to mate and give birth in the warm waters of Banderas Bay. During this season, groups of humpback whales can be seen performing impressive jumps and swimming in the vicinity of the boat. It is also possible to see other species such as gray whales, blue whales and orcas, although they are less common.","On our dolphin watching excursions, you will see several species of dolphins that inhabit the bay, including the bottlenose dolphin, the spotted dolphin and the common dolphin. These playful animals often swim alongside the boat, providing a unique and exciting experience.","Our whale and dolphin watching tours are led by guides who are experts in the local marine life. These guides will not only take you to the best areas to see whales and dolphins, but will also share with you fascinating information about these majestic creatures and their importance in the marine ecosystem.","It is important to remember that these beautiful and fascinating creatures must be treated with respect and care. For this reason, our whale and dolphin watching tours are conducted in accordance with local and national regulations that protect these species and their natural environment. It is also important to follow responsible whale watching guidelines, such as keeping a safe distance from the creatures and not interfering with their activities.","At K-not, we pride ourselves in offering an exciting and nature-friendly experience for our clients. Do not hesitate to book your whale and dolphin watching tour with us for an unforgettable experience in Puerto Vallarta!"]
